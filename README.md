# Stats507
This repo includes homeworks done in Umich STATS_507 Fall 2021
STATS_507_HW02Q3.py is a Python script including my solution to Question 3 in problem set 2. 
It reads and appends the demographic datasets keeping only columns containing the unique ids (SEQN), age (RIDAGEYR), race and ethnicity (RIDRETH3), education (DMDEDUC2), and marital status (DMDMARTL), along with the following variables related to the survey weighting: (RIDSTATR, SDMVPSU, SDMVSTRA, WTMEC2YR, WTINT2YR). An additional column identifying to which cohort each case belongs is added.
