The following is GSI's feedback on my first hw:
1. Q0: -3 for not provide both raw and formatted versions. 
2. -1 for most tilt texts.
3. Q1: -5 for missing tests.
4. -3 for interrupted process and no 
  table output
5. Overall: -10 for not provide docstring in all functions.
6. -2 for all imports aren't collected together near the start

I will make correction for comment 3, 6
